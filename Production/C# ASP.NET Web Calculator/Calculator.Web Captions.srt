This is a quick demo of my recent project an ASP.NET Online Calculator developed in C#.

2
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:17,700
The goal of the project was to convert the desktop version into a web application using ASP.NET technology.

3
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:25,533
In process of building the application I have 
used C#, ASP.NET, Bootstrap and JavaScript 
languages.

4
00:00:25,533 --> 00:00:33,633
The code from the desktop version was reused in the code behind file in order to build the Logic Layer.

5
00:00:33,633 --> 00:00:41,966
As normal the user can perform standard 
maths including negative and percentage 
calculations.

6
00:00:41,966 --> 00:00:50,499
From security perspective all of the information that the user sets while using the application is encrypted and

7
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:59,166
on each post back of the page the neccessary 
information is used to complete each operation.

8
00:00:59,166 --> 00:01:08,432
On error handling I am using code behind to 
catch the exception and also JavaScript to 
notify the user of what options they have.

9
00:01:08,433 --> 00:01:15,699
Here speaking of User Experience and providing Responsive Design for the app is hapening through Bootstrap implementation. 

10
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:20,733
Meaning that by changing the size of the display most of the content changes its location on the page for best presentation possible.
